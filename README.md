It is important to approach software develpoment with an attention to detail. By using testing
to review software it is possible to remove many mistakes and security holes. However it is 
important that both the developer and the tester pay close attention and use best pratices.
With complexity of software today it is difficult if not impossible to make things perfect.
But through careful testing many mistakes and security flaws can be removed before an
application hits the market. It is the ethical responsibilty of developers to be testing their
software to the best of their ability.
